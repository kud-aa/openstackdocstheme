    Add support for additional themes is included in the package.  The
    first theme is ``starlingxdocs``.  The initial implementation sets up
    the new theme to inherit from ``openstackdocs`` and updates some of
    the ``openstackdocs`` bits that are hard coded in the Python.

    For example::

        html_theme = 'starlingxdocs'
